This is an expansion of the Michael Nielson's neural network framework that accompanies his *Neural Networks and Deep Learning* online book.  Version 1 and version 2 are similar to Nielson's version 1 and 2.  Version 3 here includes some additional logging functionality (to compare performance across different hyperparameter settings) as well as addition of support for other activation functions.  There is also another version containing a modification in order to support for more complicated learning rate schedules.  The torch file contains a reimplementation of Nielson's CNN architecture in pytorch.

I highly recommend Michael Nielson's book to anyone interested in gettign started with deep learning.  I personally learned a lot by modifying his code and looking at various diagnostic graphs while finding my way around hyperparameter space.
